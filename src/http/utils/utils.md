# Utils
Utilities is a collection of tools for HTTP uses.

## Request
Request is the HTTP utility for contiainerizing the HTTP Request work for the libcurl interface. As it is right now REQUEST is meerly a struct with a few char* pointers. Ideally there will be additional utility added to this module.

Request is currently the only mechanism approved for submitting a HTTP request in the library.
